# FPGA-based Bluetooth Piano

This project utilizes a Digilent's Basys3 FPGA Board equipped with Xilinx's Artix-7 FPGA Chip to design a circuit that will receive 
bluetooth signals via an HC-05 Bluetooth module through the UART communication protocol and output a frequency-varied square wave to play
audible sound through an 8-ohm speaker. A mobile app is designed with a GUI that represents the layout of a piano with only an octave and a half
available for user input. This mobile app will send encoded bluetooth signals based on the key pressed and the FPGA board outputs the desired key
frequency to emulate a piano.

## Description

The HC-05 Bluetooth module operates using the UART communication protocol which has only a transmit data line and a receive data line.
This device is connected through the PMOD headers on the side of the Basys3 FPGA Board.

# 8-Ohm Speaker

## Description

The 8-ohm speaker is used to receive the square wave generated by the FPGA at a specific frequency. 

# Building Blocks

- UART (Top, Rx, and Baud Rate Generator)
- Note Decoder (Decodes received signals into note frequencies)
- Note Player (Plays the decoded notes into 8-ohm speaker)

Note that the UART modules do not require a Tx module because the FPGA is not required to send data back to the bluetooth module.
